## Hi there 👋
# About me
👋 Hey, I’m Hieu — an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer.
Welcome to my “sandbox” — a messy, curious corner of the internet where I share my projects, experiments, and the random data rabbit holes I dive into.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on applying machine learning and AI in the fitness industry — think smarter meal planning, personalized calorie tracking, and data-driven workout insights.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science foundations, the fundamentals of machine learning, and exploring the exciting world of AI.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on developing a mobile fitness application powered by AI — blending analytics with health and lifestyle to help people eat, train, and recover smarter.
